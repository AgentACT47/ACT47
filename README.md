## Overview

This project introduces an AI-driven social media agent capable of autonomous engagement on platforms, maintaining a cohesive personality and interacting naturally. Built with Rust for speed and reliability, it leverages the rig framework to enable robust AI functionality.

## Core Features

### Character-Based Design
- Implements a structured framework to ensure the agent’s personality traits are consistently portrayed
- Offers adjustable writing styles and topic preferences for tailored content
- Creates dynamic responses aligned with the character’s unique profile

### Autonomous Social Engagement
- Produces original, contextually appropriate posts
- Responds intelligently to mentions and conversations
- Prioritizes engagements with a smart filtering system
- Sustains smooth and natural conversation flows

### Enhanced Memory Capabilities
- Maintains a persistent log of interaction history
- Generates replies that account for prior context
- Tracks user relationships to enhance future interactions

### Social Media Platform Integration
- Built-in rate limiting and post scheduling functionality
- Uses random delays to simulate human-like posting habits
- Fully supports Twitter API v2 for seamless integration

### Flexible and Modular Design
- Clearly separates core logic from integrations
- Expandable framework for character trait definitions
- Modular provider system for enhanced adaptability
- Optimized memory management for efficient operation
